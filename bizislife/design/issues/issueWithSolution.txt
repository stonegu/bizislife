Issue #1:
---------
Could not get JDBC Connection; nested exception is org.apache.commons.dbcp.SQLNestedException: Cannot create PoolableConnectionFactory (Could not create connection to database server. Attempted reconnect 3 times. Giving up
Solution:
---------
Cause
-----
There is a bug, #61201, which was introduced in MySQL 5.1.16 which causes an error in the connection when the JDBC URL has both "sessionVariables" and "characterEncoding" parameters at the same time, for example:
url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/jiradb?autoReconnect=true&useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=utf8&sessionVariables=storage_engine=InnoDB"
Additionally there is another bug, #72630 that can cause problems when the file encoding is incorrectly specified - for example -Dfile.encoding=ut-8. This should be -Dfile.encoding=utf-8
Workaround
----------
The available workarounds are:
    Remove either the "sessionVariables" or "characterEncoding" parameters from the JDBC URL so they are not utilized at the same time. Since our doc states that characterEncoding=UTF8 should be defined in the JDBC URL, this means that the user will not be able to use the sessionVariables parameter.
    If both parameters have to be utilized, then downgrade to the 5.1.15 driver until this issue is resolved with 5.1.16
    Additionally ensure that the file encoding JVM argument is correctly spelt.
